## 1.Introduction：

Fueled by the rapid development of technology, smart homes automatically
controlled remotely by smart phones and other devices have become more common.
For the same reason, they have increasingly gained closer attention and caught
people’s fancy.

Bearing the aim to make improvements in household living conditions, the smart
home system has been integrated with technologies including computer science,
telecommunication, automatic control and others and emerged as a comprehensive
and smart system featuring safety, convenience, coziness, services , utility and
environmental consciousness.

## 2.Description：

Launched by Keyestudio, this smart home kit is based on the open-source hardware
of Micro:bit and designed for those who dream of living a more comfortable life
with the help of technologies.

This smart home system, with Micro:bit as its control board, is equipped with a
1602 LCD, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, an analog gas sensor(MQ_2), a
PIR motion sensor , a 6812 RGB module, a servo, a steam sensor, a Micro:bit BT
and other sensors.

With the help of these sensors, this kit can be applied to detect temperature,
humidity and the concentration of flammable gases in your home and open and
close doors. Furthermore, all the information detected can display on 1602 LCD
in real time available for you to check and monitor via smart phones or iPad. By
the way, it supports powering by solar energy or via USB cable.

This tutorial will guide you to make and control the smart home kit by the code
written in the online graphical programming platform Makecode. In this process,
not only can you enhance your ability to make stuffs but also learn the skills
of programming.

MakeCode for micro:bit is the most widely used graphical programming environment
on the micro:bit official website. It is based on the graphical programming
environment developed by Microsoft's open source project MakeCode. This
graphical programming can also be converted to textual version, namely Python or
JavaScript. The combination of code and graphics makes it very convenient and
easy to learn. At the same time, it can be simulated or programmed for
electronic components.

# Preparations:

1.  **Background Information about Micro:bit**

**( 1 )What is Micro:bit?**

Micro:bit is an open source hardware platform based on the ARM architecture
launched by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) together with ARM, Barclays,
element14, Microsoft and other institutions. The core device is a 32-bit Arm
Cortex-M4 with FPU micro-processing.

Though it is just the size of a credit card, the Micro:bit main board is
equipped with loads of components,including a 5\*5 LED dot matrix, 2
programmable buttons, an accelerometer, a compass, a thermometer, a
touch-sensitive logo and a MEMS microphone, a Bluetooth module of low energy,
and a buzzer and others. Thus, it also boasts multiple functions.

The buzzer built in the other side of the board makes playing all kinds of sound
possible without any external equipment. The golden fingers and gears added
provide a better fixing of crocodile clips. Moreover, this board has a sleeping
mode to lower power consumption of batteries and it can be entered if users long
press the Reset & Power button on the back of it. It is capable of reading the
data of sensors, controlling servos and RGB lights and attaching with a shield
so as to connect with various sensors. It also supports a variety of codes and
graphical programming platforms, and is compatible with almost all PCs and
mobile devices. It has no need to install drivers. It is of high integration of
electronic modules, and has a serial port monitoring function for easy
debugging.

The board has found wild applications. It can be applied in programming video
games, making interactions between light and sound, controlling a robot,
conducting scientific experiments, developing wearable devices and make some
cool inventions like robots and musical instruments, basically everything
imaginable.

**( 2 )Layout**

![](media/ae1ddaa286548b2e6414a8284f85325d.png)

For the Micro: Bit main board, pressing the Reset & Power button, it will reset
the board and rerun the program.If you hold it tight, the red LED will slowly
get darker.When the power indicator flickers into darkness, releasing the button
and your Micro: Bit board will enter sleep mode for power saving .This will make
the battery more durable. And you could press this button again to‘wake up’your
Micro:bit.

**( 4 )Notes for the application of Micro:bit main board**

1.  It is recommended to cover it with a silicone protector to prevent short
    circuit for it has a lot of sophisticated electronic components.

1.  Its IO port is very weak in driving since it can merely handle current less
    than 300mA. Therefore, do not connect it with devices operating in large
    current, such as servo MG995 and DC motor or it will get burnt. Furthermore,
    you must figure out the current requirements of the devices before you use
    them and it is generally recommended to use the board together with a
    Micro:bit shield.

1.  It is recommended to power the main board via the USB interface or via the
    battery of 3V. The IO port of this board is 3V, so it does not support
    sensors of 5V. If you need to connect sensors of 5 V, a Micro: Bit expansion
    board is required.

1.  When using pins(P3, P4, P6, P7 and P10)shared with the LED dot matrix,
    blocking them from the matrix or the LEDs may display randomly and the data
    about sensors connected maybe wrong.

1.  Pin 19 and 20 can not be used as IO ports though the Makecode shows they
    can. They can only be used as I2C communication.

1.  The battery port of 3V cannot be connected with battery more than 3.3V or
    the main board will be damaged.

1.  Forbid to operate it on metal products to avoid short circuit.

To put it simple, Micro:bit V2 main board is like a microcomputer which has made
programming at our fingertips and enhanced digital innovation. And as for
programming environment, BBC provides a website: <https://microbit.org/code/,>
which has a graphical MakeCode program easy for use.

## 4.2.Install Micro:bit driver

Micro:bit is free of driver installation. However, in case your computer fail to
recognize the main board, you can install the diver too.

Just enter the link https://fs.keyestudio.com/KS4027-4028

to download the driver file ![](media/78709f5e0a6fdbd6a0f1c47873273353.png) of
micro:bit in file folder ![](media/0639221bcfa4728e2f8eeb5bc81a73d3.png).

**5.Getting Started with Micro:bit**

The following instructions are applied for Windows system but can also serve as
a reference if you are using a different system.

**5.1 Write code and program**

This chapter describes how to write program and load the program to the Micro:
Bit main board V2.

You are recommended to browse the official website of Micro:bit for more
details, and the link is attached below:

[https://microbit.org/guide/quick/](Https://microbit.org/guide/quick/)

**Step 1: connect the Micro: Bit main board with your computer**

Firstly, link the Micro: Bit main board with your computer via the USB cable.
Macs, PCs, Chromebooks and Linux（including Raspberry Pi）systems are all
compatible with the Micro: Bit main board.

Note that if you are about to pair the board with your phone or tablet, please
refer to this link:

[https:/microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/)

![6(1)](media/b5a90ee5338cd7fb96e135fe71a79a61.png)
![5(1)](media/18c70cf16dcf8c9694a1af8b12530cf9.png)

Secondly, if the red LED on the back of the board is on, that means the board is
powered. When your computer communicates with the main board via the USB cable,
the yellow LED on it will flashes. For example, it will flicker when you burn a
“hex”file.

Then Micro: bit main board will appear on your computer as a driver named
“MICROBIT(E:)”. Please note that it is not an ordinary USB disk as shown below.

![](media/a2b53f93f4c24b81fc5cdb5986fd100d.png)

**Step 2: write programs**

View the link <https://makecode.microbit.org/> in your browser;

Click ‘New Project’;

The dialog box‘Create a Project’ appears, fill it with‘heartbeat’and click
‘Create √’to edit.

(If you are running Windows 10 system, it is also viable to edit on the APP
MakeCode for micro:bit , which is exactly like editing in the website. And the
link to the APP is
[https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/makecode-for-micro-bit/9pjc7sv48lcx?ocid=badgep&rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/makecode-for-micro-bit/9pjc7sv48lcx?ocid=badgep&rtc=1#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
)

Take Google Chrome as an example as shown below and it is almost the same for
other browsers.

![](media/fd741a4a932cf25b5165c8135b512848.png)

![](media/f76062b0607cfca5d20bc26199b2f711.png)

Write a set of micro:bit code. You can drag some modules in the Blocks to the
editing area and then run your program in Simulator of MakeCode editor as shown
in the picture below which demonstrates how to edit ‘heartbeat’ program .

The path to the demonstration video:

.../2. Makecode Tutorial\\Makecode Code\\Project Code/Project 1：Heart beat

The next chapter will illustrate more details about Makecode.

![](media/215b27bc1633c62d16fe208e06e39ad9.png)

Click the arrow behind “JS JavaScript”to choose between“JavaScript”or
“Python”and you will find the corresponding program in JavaScript language or
Python language as shown below:

![](media/67b86dacacfb0d716068af592d79382a.png)

![](media/c3950b45a80b660c60d4ca8544c6acbd.png)

**Step 3: download code**

If your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the APP MakeCode for
micro:bit to write program, what you will have to do to download the program to
your Micro: Bit main board is merely clicking the ‘Download’ button, then all is
done.

If you are writing program through the website, following these steps:

Click the ‘Download’ in the editor to download a "hex" file, which is a compact
program format that the Micro: Bit main board can read. Once the hexadecimal
file is downloaded, copy it to your board just like the process that you copy
the file to the USB driver. If you are running Windows system, you can also
right-click and select ‘Send to → MICROBIT(E:) ‘to copy the hex file to the
Micro: Bit main board.

![](media/c5b462b6e3acbfedf6c9b22e4651d69a.png)

![无标题](media/a81d4430eb152346d13bf67b2233b9db.png)

You can also directly drag the "hex" file onto the MICROBIT (E:) disk.

![无标题](media/fe0f2de72ba0b38f00403f1aaef7f514.png)

![无标题](media/b4f3602c0e192646f77b150e2acaf947.png)

During the process of copying the downloaded hex file to the Micro: bit main
board, the yellow signal light on the back side of the board flashes. When the
copy is completed, the yellow signal light will stop flashing and remain on.

**Step 4: run the program：**

After the program is uploaded to the Micro: bit main board, you could still
power it via the USB cable or change to via an external power. The 5 x 5 LED dot
matrix on the board displays the heartbeat pattern.

| ![7](media/672bfb4d87b938fc586a849bff0229fe.png) | ![8](media/d61a26d2f2367f0378974832f679efe1.png) |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Power via USB cable                              | Power via external power (3V)                    |

**Caution:**

When you programs each time, the driver of Micro: bit will automatically eject
and return and your hexadecimal files will disappear . And the board can only
have access to hexadecimal files (hex) and save no other files.

**Step 5：about other programming languages**

This chapter has described how to use the Micro:bit main board.

But except for the Makecode graphical programming introduced you can also write
Micro:bit programs in other languages. Go to the link:
<https://microbit.org/code/> to know about other programming languages , or view
the link: <https://microbit.org/projects/>, to find something you want to have a
go.

## 5.2.Makecode：

Browse <https://makecode.microbit.org/> and enter Makecode online editor or open
the APP MakeCode for micro:bit of Windows 10.

![](media/285f5ee70c3d95855f87a17d227b8675.png)

Click“New Project”, and input“heartbeat”, then click “create √”to enter Makecode
editor, as shown below:

![IMG_256](media/5d8174f605724953bcb4a00edade8f30.png)

There are blocks“on start”and“forever”in the code editing area.

When the power is plugged or reset,“on start”means that the code in the block
only executes once, while“forever”implies that the code runs cyclically.

## 5.3 Quick Download

As mentioned before, if your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the
APP MakeCode for micro:bit to write programs, the program written can be quickly
downloaded to the Micro: Bit main board by selecting ‘Download’.

While it is a little more trickier if you are using a browser to enter Makecode.
However, if you use Google Chrome, suitable for Linux，macOS and Windows 10, the
process can be quicker too.

We use the webUSB function of Chrome to allow the internet page to access the
hardware device connected USB.

![](media/818a03c369319240dc38e23af5c21ec2.png)

## 5.4.Resources and test code

We also provide a link：https://fs.keyestudio.com/KS4027-4028

containing the information of the product from relevant tools to test codes,
tutorials and troubleshooting methods as well, as shown in the figure below:

![](media/f7cc0f0ff37a6267dce479048ae6c655.png)

## 5.5.Input test code

We provide hexadecimal code files (project files) for each project. The file
contains all the contents of the project and can be imported directly, or you
can manually drag the code blocks to complete the program for each project. For
simple projects, dragging a block of code to complete the program is
recommended.For complex projects, it is recommended to conduct the program by
importing the hexadecimal code file we provide.

Let's take the "Heatbeat" project as an example to show how to load the code.

Open the Web version of Makecode or the Windows 10 App version of Makecode;

![](media/40e8e36d4a7e9b8a726ff1a832393df5.png)

Click“Import File”;

![](media/3358909f898dd9898923f72945613851.png)

![](media/ff66d0d78d170913676e361a62078faf.png)

Select“../Makecode Code/Project 1\_ Heart beat/Project 1\_ Heart beat.hex”

Then click “Go ahead”.

![](media/c919527e842cb6dd603a03b8f850a7f8.png)

![](media/b5f985386359a415c102d3deefecce53.png)

In addition to importing the test code file provided into the Makecode compiler
above, you can also drag the the test code file provided into the code editing
area of the Makecode compiler, as shown in the figure below:

![dsBuffer.bmp](media/115cceaf5de0eb4f2079ca09681dbb7c.png)

After a few seconds, it is done.

![](media/a451132713cbd16f3f7957c5312673ba.png)

Note: if your computer system is Windows7 or 8 instead of Windows 10, the
pairing cannot be done via Google Chrome. Therefore, digital signal or analog
signal of sensors and modules cannot be shown on the serial port simulator.
However, you need to read the corresponding digital signal or analog signal.So

**(4)Introduction of components:**

The LED dot matrix consists of 25 LEDs arranged in a 5 by 5 square. In order to
locate these LEDs quickly, as the figure shown below, we can regarded this
matrix as a coordinate system and create two aces by marking those in rows from
0 to 4 from top to bottom, and the ones in columns from 0 to 4 from the left to
the right. Therefore, the LED sat in the second of the first line is (1,0）and
the LED positioned in the fifth of the fourth column is (3,4）and others
likewise.

**Project 3: LED Dot Matrix**

![](media/8c3f540a07aab97e1608ba8770837f7b.png)

1.  **Project Introduction**

Dot matrices are very commonplace in daily life. They have found wide
applications in LED advertisement screens, elevator floor display, bus stop
announcement and so on.

The LED dot matrix of Micro: Bit main board contains 25 LEDs in a grid.
Previously, we have succeeded in controlling a certain LED to light by
integrating its position value into the test code. Supported by the same theory,
we can turn on many LEDs at the same time to showcase patterns, digits and
characters.

What’s more, we can also click”show icon“ to choose the pattern we like to
display. Last but not the least, we can design patterns by ourselves as well.

**Project 4: Programmable Buttons**

![](media/06be84fb11b1fd07cd0cbb392132b903.png)

1.  **Project Introduction**

Buttons can be used to control circuits. In an integrated circuit with a push
button, the circuit is connected when pressing the button and it is open the
other way around.

Micro: Bit main board boasts three push buttons, two are programmable
buttons(marked with A and B), and the one on the other side is a reset button.
By pressing the two programmable buttons can input three different signals. We
can press button A or B alone or press them together and the LED dot matrix
shows A,B and AB respectively. Let’s get started.

**Project 5: Temperature Detection**

![](media/206c8ec1c3f11d2de8d0f42fdf5b6b47.png)

1.  **Project Introduction**

The Micro:bit main board is not equipped with a temperature sensor, but uses the
temperature sensor built into NFR52833 chip for temperature detection.
Therefore, the detected temperature is more closer to the temperature of the
chip, and there maybe deviation from the ambient temperature. The sensor can
detect temperature of external environment with the range of 40℃\~105℃.

**Project 6: Geomagnetic Sensor**

![](media/24c31bb0174e2ac672203e5c36c6875e.png)

1.  **Project Introduction**

This project aims to explain the use of the Micro: bit geomagnetic sensor, which
can not only detect the strength of the geomagnetic field, but also be used as a
compass to find bearings. It is also an important part of the Attitude and
Heading Reference System (AHRS).

Micro: Bit main board uses LSM303AGR geomagnetic sensor, which supports four
modes namely 100 kHz,400 kHz,1 MHz and 3.4 MHz and the dynamic range of magnetic
field is ±50 gauss.

In the board, the magnetometer module is used in both magnetic detection and
compass. In this experiment, the compass will be introduced first, and then the
original data of the magnetometer will be checked.The main component of a common
compass is a magnetic needle, which can be rotated by the geomagnetic field and
point toward the geomagnetic North Pole (which is near the geographic South
Pole) to determine direction.

Attention: this geomagnetic sensor built in the board can help us determine
bearings by showing readings in the value from 0 to 360. And the system will ask
us to calibrate it the first time it is put into operation by rotating the
board.Please note that metal materials around may attenuate the accuracy of the
reading and calibration.

Note: it is imperative to calibrate the Micro:bit board for different
geomagnetic fields existing in different places. And the system will make an
automatic requirement if it is used for the first time.

**(5)Test Result1：**

After uploading Test Code 1 to micro:bit main board and powering the board via
the USB cable, and pressing the button A, the board asks us to calibrate compass
and the LED dot matrix shows “TILT TO FILL SCREEN”. Then enter the calibration
page. Rotate the board until all 25 red LEDs are on as shown below.

![1(5)](media/acf3b8c0dee027d9e555fc708831f874.jpeg)

After that, a smile pattern
![IMG_256](media/55ad39536dff7bdf66379a1da7a4c137.png) appears, which implies
the calibration is done. When the calibration process is completed, pressing the
button A will make the magnetometer reading display directly on the screen. And
the direction north, east, south and west correspond to 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°
respectively.

![](media/24c31bb0174e2ac672203e5c36c6875e.png)

1.  **Project Introduction**

The Micro: Bit main board V2 has a built-in LSM303AGR gravity acceleration
sensor, also known as accelerometer, with a resolution of 8/10/12 bits. The code
section sets the range to 1g, 2g, 4g, and 8g.

We often use accelerometer to detect the status of machines.

In this project, we will introduce how to measure the position of the board with
the accelerometer. And then have a look at the original three-axis data output
by the accelerometer.

1.  **Project Introduction**

The Micro: Bit main board is built with a microphone which can test the volume
of ambient environment. When you clap, the microphone LED indicator turns on.
Since it can measure the intensity of sound, you can make a noise scale or disco
lighting changing with music. The microphone is placed on the opposite side of
the microphone LED indicator and in proximity with holes that lets sound
pass.When the board detects sound, the LED indicator lights up.

G2 fall off and the role G is controlled by Button A and B to shun them. If the
role fail to avert the attacks, the game is over.

**(7)Game Rule 2:**

Built on the rule1, a new rule is added that one will get score in this game.
And with the accumulation of the score, the difficulty of this game mounts. The
detail of rule2 is that when the role G dodge a bullet, 1 score is gained and
that the game stops when it is hit and the game is over after the display of the
scores. Like rule1, the game will restart when button A and B pressed together.

## Project 14: Bluetooth Wireless Communication

![](media/55b2424d88ba1ba8a711c49418ca8dc6.png)

**(1)Project Introduction**

The Micro: Bit main board comes with a nRF52833 processor (with a built-in
BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) device Bluetooth 5.1 ) and a 2.4GHz antenna for
Bluetooth wireless communication and 2.4GHz wireless communication. With the
help of them, the board is able to communicate with a variety of Bluetooth
devices, including smart phones and tablets.

In this project, we mainly concentrate on the Bluetooth wireless communication
function of this main board. Linked with Bluetooth, it can transmit code or
signals. To this end, we should connect an Apple device (a phone or an iPad) to
the board.

Since setting up Android phones to achieve wireless transmission is similar to
that of Apple devices, no need to illustrate again.

# 8.Expansion Projects：

The former 14 projects are the introduction of sensors and modules. The further
lessons are challenging for new starters.

Note: (G), marked on each sensor and module, is the negative pole and connected
to “G”, ”-”or “GND”on the sensor shield or control board ; (V) is the positive
pole and linked with V , VCC, + or 5V on the sensor shield or control board. And
you need to connect a power in case that power supply is weak.

## Project 1：LED Blinks

![13](media/98c9efc46d004ad501e0fe56f826a69c.png)

**(1)Project Introduction**

We’ve set up the micro:bit smart home. Now let’s get started from the most
simple experiment---LED blink.

LED is a type of semiconductor called "Light Emitting Diode "which is an
electronic device made of semiconductor materials (silicon, selenium, germanium,
etc.). It features unidirectional conductivity, that is, the positive voltage is
applied to the anode (long leg) and the cathode (short leg) of the diode. when
the voltage of its anode is higher than the voltage of its cathode, thus, the
diode is turned on(LED is on). When a reverse voltage is applied to the anode
and cathode, the diode is disconnected(that is, the LED is off). Therefore, the
disconnection and connection of the diode is equivalent to turning on and off
LED. Light-emitting diodes have an anode (+) and a cathode (-), and they can
only allow current to flow from one anode to the cathode. The components will be
damaged if LED is directly connected to the power supply. It’s essential that a
certain resistor must be connected in series in the LED circuit.

**Project 2：Breathing LED**

![13](media/98c9efc46d004ad501e0fe56f826a69c.png)

1.  **Project Introduction**

In previous lesson, we control LED on and off and make it blink.

In this project, we will control LED’s brightness through PWM simulating
breathing effect. Similarly, you can change the step length and delay time in
the code so as to demonstrate different breathing effects.

PWM is a means of controlling the analog output via digital means. Digital
control is used to generate square waves with different duty cycles (a signal
that constantly switches between high and low levels) to control the analog
output.In general, the input voltages of ports are 0V and 3V. What if the 1.5V
is required? Or a switch among 1V, 1.5V and 3V? We cannot change resistors
constantly. For this reason, we resort to PWM.

For Micro:bit digital port voltage outputs, there are only LOW and HIGH levels,
which correspond to the voltage outputs of 0V and 3V respectively. You can
define LOW as“0”and HIGH as“ 1’, and let Micro:bit output five
hundred“0”or‘1’within 1 second. If output five hundred‘1”, that is 3V; if all of
which is‘0’,that is 0V; if output 250 01 pattern, that is 1.5V.

This process can be likened to showing a movie. The movie we watch are not
completely continuous. Actually, it generates 25 pictures per second, which
cannot be told by human eyes. Therefore, we mistake it as a continuous process.
PWM works in the same way. To output different voltages, we need to control the
ratio of 0 and 1. The more‘0’or ‘1’ output per unit time, the more accurate the
control.

In the graphic below, the green lines represent a regular time period. This
duration or period is the inverse of the PWM frequency. In other words, with
Micro:bit's PWM frequency at about 500Hz, the green lines would measure 2
milliseconds each. A call to analogWrite() is on a scale of 0-255, such that
analogWrite(255) requests a 100% duty cycle (always on), and analogWrite(127) is
a 50% duty cycle (on half the time).

![图1](media/704984700612966b997127cb9bde5c96.jpeg)

PWM is applied to light brightness adjustment, speed adjustment of motor and
sound emitting.

Parameters of PWM：

pulse width (minimum / max)

Pulse cycle (insertion of pulse frequency within 1 second)

Voltage level（0V-3V）

There are commonly used PWM ports, namely P0, P1, P2, P3, P4 and P10. And there
are other rarely used ports, namely P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15,
P16, P19 and P20.

In the experiment, we connect the port S of yellow LED Module to the port S (16)
of the expansion board. And P16 can also be used as a PWM interface.

## Project 3：6812 2x2 Full Color RGB

![16](media/cdebaf0805f0e933e1ccfb3691258bc7.png)

**(1)Project Introduction**

6812 2X2 full-color RGB module integrates the controlling circuit and the
illuminating circuit. Each LED is the same as a 5050 LED lamp bead, and each
component is a pixel point. The inner pixel point includes a amplify driving
circuit that latch signal from digital ports shapes, a high-precision internal
oscillator and and a 12V high voltage programmable current control portion,
which effectively ensures that the color of the pixel point.

The data protocol uses a single-line zero code communication method. After the
pixel point is reset, the S-terminal receives the data transmitted from the
controller. First, the 24bit data sent by the first pixel is extracted by the
first pixel point, and sent to the internal portion of the pixel point.

It has the advantages of low-voltage driving, environmental protection, high
brightness, large scattering angle, good consistency, ultra-low power, long life
expectancy.

**Project 4：PIR Motion Sensor**

![15](media/8e527b21d2e89c43f0fa894cb32f55c8.png)

**(1)Project Introduction**

The Pyroelectric infrared motion sensor can detect infrared signals from moving
objects, and output switching signals. Applied to a variety of occasions, it can
detect movement of human body.

Conventional pyroelectric infrared sensors are much more bigger, with complex
circuit and lower reliability. Yet, this new pyroelectric infrared motion
sensor, is more practical. It integrates a digital pyroelectric infrared sensor
and connecting pins. It features higher sensibility and reliability, lower power
consumption, light weight, small size, lower voltage working mode and simpler
peripheral circuit.

If your computer system is Windows7/8 instead of Windows 10, the device can’t be
paired in Google Chrome, as a result, the digital and analog signals can’t be
read.

Here, we need CoolTerm software to read data.

Open CoolTerm, click Options to select SerialPort. Set COM port and 115200 baud
rate(the baud rate of USB serial communication of micro:bit V2 is 115200 through
the test). Click“OK”and“Connect”.

**Project 6: Adjust angles of servo**

![](media/6f0776b01b35f18b0568158ffbbc7a77.png)

1.  **Project Introduction**

![](media/69be958142b773acdae33eeef12afed7.png)

Servo motor is a position control rotary actuator. It mainly consists of a
housing, a circuit board, a core-less motor, a gear and a position sensor. Its
working principle is that the servo receives the signal sent by MCU or receiver
and produces a reference signal with a period of 20ms and width of 1.5ms, then
compares the acquired DC bias voltage to the voltage of the potentiometer and
obtain the voltage difference output.

When the motor speed is constant, the potentiometer is driven to rotate through
the cascade reduction gear, which leads that the voltage difference is 0, and
the motor stops rotating. Generally, the angle range of servo rotation is 0°
\--180°.

1.  **Working Principle of Servo：**

The rotation angle of servo motor is controlled by regulating the duty cycle of
PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signal. The standard cycle of PWM signal is 20ms
(50Hz). Theoretically, the width is distributed between 1ms-2ms, but in fact,
it's between 0.5ms-2.5ms. The width corresponds the rotation angle from 0° to
180°. But note that for different brand motors, the same signal may have
different rotation angles.

![6780083(1)](media/0982cb7b28f4accde7d378ba812c8bcb.png)

Through the experiment, the pulse range of the servo is 0.65ms\~2.5ms.

| high level time | Servo angle | Reference signal cycle time（20ms） |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0.65ms          | 0°          | 0.65ms high level+19.35mslow level  |

## Project 9：1602 LCD

![KS0062 (4)](media/b28242c31d938ab51c634aa121490ffa.jpeg)

1.  **Project Introduction**

With I2C communication module, this is a display module that can show 2 lines
with 16 characters per line.

It shows blue background and white word and connects to I2C interface of MCU,
which highly save the MCU resources.

On the back of LCD display, there is a blue potentiometer for adjusting the
backlight. The communication address defaults to 0x27.

The original 1602 LCD can start and run with 7 IO ports, but ours is built with
Arduino IIC/I2C interface, saving 5 IO ports. Alternatively, the module comes
with 4 positioning holes with a diameter of 3mm, which is convenient for you to
fix on other devices.

Notice that when the screen gets brighter or darker, the characters will become
more visible or less visible.

## Project 10：Steam Sensor

![14](media/932398f7831e7e6d0f1c0b6f035a79a4.png)

**(1)Project Introduction**

This is a commonly used steam sensor. Its principle is to detect the amount of
water by bare printed parallel lines on the circuit board. The more the water
content is, the more wires will be connected. As the conductive contact coverage
increases, the output voltage will gradually rise. It can detect water vapor in
the air as well. The steam sensor can be used as a rain water detector and level
switch. When the humidity on the sensor surface surges, the output voltage will
increase.

The sensor is compatible with various microcontroller control boards, such as
Arduino series microcontrollers. When using it, connect the sensor to the analog
port of the Micro:bit microcontroller, and display the corresponding analog
value on the serial monitor.

Note: the connection part is not waterproof, therefore, don’t immerse it in the
water please.

## Project 12：Analog Gas（MQ-2）Sensor

![17](media/5ad704f1db5e43058513cf8ed2d53047.png)

**(1)Project Introduction**

This gas sensor is used for household gas leak alarms, industrial combustible
gas alarms and portable gas detection instruments. Also, it is suitable for the
detection of liquefied gas, benzene, alkane, alcohol, hydrogen, etc.,

The MQ-2 smoke sensor can be accurately a multi-gas detector, with the
advantages of high sensitivity, fast response, good stability, long life, and
simple drive circuit.

It can detect the concentration of flammable gas and smoke in the range of
300\~10000ppm. Meanwhile, it has high sensitivity to natural gas, liquefied
petroleum gas and other smoke, especially to alkanes smoke.

It must be heated for a period of time before using the smoke sensor, otherwise
the output resistance and voltage are not accurate. However, the heating voltage
should not be too high, otherwise it will cause internal signal line to blow.

It belongs to the tin dioxide semiconductor gas-sensitive material. At a certain
temperature, tin dioxide adsorbs oxygen in the air and forms negative ion
adsorption of oxygen, reducing the electron density in the semiconductor,
thereby increasing its resistance value.

When in contact with flammable gas in the air and smog, and the potential
barrier at the grain boundary is adjusted by the smog, it will cause the surface
conductivity to change. With this, information about the presence of smoke or
flammable gas can be obtained. The greater the concentration of smoke or
flammable gas in the air, the greater the conductivity, and the lower the output
resistance, the larger the analog signal output. In addition, the sensitivity
can be adjusted by rotating the potentiometer.

**DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor：**

|                 | **Single-bus data format**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initial signal  | The microprocessor pulls down the data bus(SDA) for at least 18 ms (less than 30 ms)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Response signal | The sensor pulls down the data bus (SDA) 83 μs, and then pulls up 87 μs to respond to the initial signal of the host.                                                                                                                                          |
|  humidity       | The humidity high-bit is the humidity integer part of the data, the humidity low-bit is the humidity fractional part of the data.                                                                                                                              |
|   temperature   | The temperature high-bit is the temperature integer part of the data, the temperature low-bit is the temperature fractional part of the data. And the temperature low bit8 is 1, which indicates the negative temperature; otherwise the positive temperature. |
| Check bit       | Check bit = humidity high bit + humidity low bit+ temperature high bit + temperature low bit                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Overall Communication Process：**

After the user host (MCU) sends a start signal, the DHT11 is converted from the
low consumption mode to the high one. After the start signal is completed, the
DHT11 sends the 40bit data, triggering an information collection. The signal
transmission is shown in the figure.

Communication protocol of DHT11 Sensor：
